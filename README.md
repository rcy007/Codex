This repository contains a simple Node.js command line app to convert an amount in USD to Indian Rupees (INR) and British Pounds (GBP).

## How to run

Ensure you have Node.js installed. From this directory, run the script and follow the prompt:

```bash
./currency.js
```

The program will ask for an amount in USD and fetch the latest exchange rates from [open.er-api.com](https://open.er-api.com/). It then prints the equivalent amounts in INR and GBP.

## Simple Todo App

A minimal todo list lives in [`todo.html`](./todo.html) and [`todo.js`](./todo.js). Open the HTML file in any modern browser to manage tasks without installing dependencies. The interface lets you add new todos, mark them complete, delete individual items, and clear all completed tasks. Todos are stored in the browser's `localStorage` so they persist between sessions.
