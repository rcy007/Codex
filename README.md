This repository contains a simple Node.js command line app to convert an amount in USD to Indian Rupees (INR) and British Pounds (GBP).

## How to run

Ensure you have Node.js installed. From this directory, run the script and follow the prompt:

```bash
./currency.js
```

The program will ask for an amount in USD and fetch the latest exchange rates from [open.er-api.com](https://open.er-api.com/). It then prints the equivalent amounts in INR and GBP.
